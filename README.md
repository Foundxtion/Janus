# Janus
In the Roman Mythology, Janus was the God of Gates, Doorways... While this repository is *obviously* not a roman God, it aims to provide some authentication mechanisms simply and quickly deployable for Foundxtion deployed machines. 

# Used in Janus
- The docker image from `osixia/docker-openldap` in order to deploy a simple container openldap server.
